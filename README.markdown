this is a tool, commissioned by my friend hoodie, to tell all your followers that you've moved accounts

## run your own

this is static and can be served by any web server. there is a build step though

### build

```
$ yarn install || npm install
...
$ yarn run build || npm run build
```

the built files are in the `dist/` directory
